							<h2>Rapid DNA Prototyping Standard</h2>
							<p>Rapid DNA Prototyping (RDP) is an increasingly popular open source standard for synthetic biology. With its flexible and intuitive system of universally connecting ‘ends,’ the Lego-like RDP Standard makes the design, construction, and validation of sophisticated genetic circuits dramatically more efficient.</p>
							
							<p>The standard’s modularly designed building block parts can be arranged and assembled into complex circuits accurately, in high yield, and quickly (in hours as opposed to days or weeks), in a biologically-ready form that can be easily ported into an organism and booted for validation.</p> 
							<p>Developed by Professor Michael Ellison in the department of Biochemistry at the University of Alberta, the RDP was awarded Best Foundational Advance at the 2009 International Genetically Engineered Machines competition at MIT. It represents a new paradigm where bio-innovators may design, create, validate and iterate on sophisticated, multi-component genetic circuits with unprecedented speed and flexibility.</p>

								<p>The RDP Standard makes genetic engineering accessible to everyone. Curious minds, without a Ph.D or access to a lab, can now prototype genetic circuits, testing hypotheses rapidly and reliably. Experienced scientists too will enjoy the new levels of flexibility enabled by Rapid DNA Prototyping.</p>
								<p>Each RDP Standard circuit begins with an anchor, followed by a series of component parts, and ends with a cap. The component parts (products, controllers, and modifiers) are used to create custom designed circuits.</p>

							<div class="collapse" id="collapseParts">
								<p>Like LEGO or any other standardized connecting system, the RDP Standard is composed of parts with different functions that snap together in a variety of configurations.</p>
								<h4 class="parts-box green">Assembly Scaffold</h4>
								<p>The assembly scaffold is a collection of required parts that are common to any RDP Standard circuit design. These include anchors, adapters, and caps which are respectively used to initiate, extend, and terminate, the assembly process. The anchor and cap are specialized multi-functional parts that assure a circuit survives and functions within a living organism.</p>
								<h4 class="parts-box purple-red">Products</h4>
								<p>Products are protein molecules that function on their own or in concert with other products to produce cellular outputs that can be easily detected during or following cell growth. Such observable outputs may include colours, light emissions, and scents.</p>
								<h4 class="parts-box blue">Controllers</h4>
								<p>These parts — which include promoters, operators, regulators, activators, terminators, and ribosomal binding sites — are used to control the expression of a given product. Rules of production can be customized and achieved by selecting the appropriate controllers and modifiers.</p>
								<h4 class="parts-box pink">Modifiers</h4>
								<p>Modifiers are added to either end of a product part to affect its structure and behaviour. They can be used to link products together, add molecular handles for identification and purification, provide addresses that direct products to different regions within the cell, and to create signals that can shorten the lifespan of the product.</p>

		                		<p>All standard component parts are provided as either one, or both, of two forms: X-Z’ and Z-X’. These designations refer to types of RDP ends. Connectors function like plugs and sockets: X is linked to its counterpart X’ and, Z is linked to its counterpart Z’.</p>
		                		<p>X-Z’ and Z-X’ parts can be linked to each other but not to themselves; every circuit exists as a string of alternating parts, beginning with an anchor and ending with a cap.</p>
		                		<p>As with the component parts, anchors and caps exist in two forms. The right-hand end of an anchor terminates with either an X’ or Z’ connector to accommodate the addition of either a X-Z’ or Z-X’ part type. Similarly, the left-hand end of the cap terminates with either a X or Z connector so that it can be added to either a X-Z’ or Z-X’ part type.</p>

			                		<p>Circuits are built step-by-step, starting with an anchor. Component parts are added sequentially. Finally, a cap is used to terminate and circularize the genetic construct.</p>
			                		<p>The anchor is first attached to microscopic magnetic particles called beads. Coupled to each bead are many copies of a short stretch of single-stranded DNA that binds to a complementary single-stranded segment contained on the anchor. This interaction is reversible so that when the construction of the circuit is complete, the entire build can be released from the beads.</p>
			                		<p>The first part of the circuit is then combined with the bead-anchor complex in the presence of an enzyme called DNA ligase, the molecular glue that links the two pieces of DNA together. When the reaction is complete, any remaining ligase and unused parts have to be removed from the reaction since unwanted parts will result in assembly errors at subsequent stages of the build. This is done by collecting and holding the bead-bound DNA to the side of tube with a magnet. Once the reaction liquid has been removed and the beads washed, the magnet is removed and the beads are suspended for the next round of part addition.</p>
			                		<p>This process is repeated until the circuit is completed by the addition of the cap. The build is then released from the beads as a population of linear double-stranded DNA molecules.</p>
			                		<p>A ‘bio-ready’ circuit that is capable of surviving and functioning in E. coli requires that it enter the cell in circular form. At the distal end of the cap is a segment of single-stranded DNA that is complementary to the segment at the proximal end of the anchor. The interaction between these two segments circularizes the DNA in a spontaneous reaction that happens very quickly upon release of the circuit from the beads.</p>
			                		<p>Only a few of a great many cells actually take up the circuit which then have to be identified, selected and enriched. The anchor contains a gene that confers antibiotic resistance (AbR) to the host cell so that only cells that have incorporated the circuit will grow in the presence of the antibiotic.</p>
			                		<p>The survival of the circuit also depends upon its ability to copy itself repeatedly to meet the demand of cell division. This function is provided by a segment of DNA within the cap sequence called the origin of replication (Ori).</p>
